.commits
- contains all the changes to files.
- each file in .commits is one change.
- each file in .commits is encrypted with the same key
- same system as datalog

- a file has an ID
- a file points to a list of data chunks
- a data chunk is just a bunch of bytes
- an ID has a name, and a modification date
- a directory has an ID
- an ID can be renamed
- an ID can be deleted

example:
[file 1]
[file-info 1 "hello world.txt" 2018-3-10-13:14:12.111]
[chunk 1 0x1237991367123821732161897321764843792193762871643682971372648123...]
[file-data :id 1 :offset 0 :chunk 1 :count 10000]
[file-data :id 1 :offset 10000 :chunk 2 :count 1000]
[delete :id 1]


with this encoding, deduplication can be implemented. Chunks are compressed and then encrypted.

This is probably easiest to implement in C# or maybe even python.
